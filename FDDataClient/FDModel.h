#pragma mark - Class Interface

/**
FDModel is an abstract model class that allows for easy creation from remote objects (i.e. NSDictionary, NSString, NSValue). Users only need to override the remoteKeyPathsToLocalKeyPaths method in their subclasses of FDModel to define what remote key paths map to local key paths and all of the parsing, transformation and setting of those local key paths are handled automatically. 

FDModel guarantees that if an instance of it is created with an identifier only one instance of that model will ever exist in memory at any given time. All instances of FDModel created with an identifier are stored in a weakly retained cache that ensures if an instance of FDModel is referenced by anything it will always exist in memory. During low memory situations this cache will be purged of models that are no longer retained by anything. To have this identifier automatically be set during the conversion process the remoteKeyPathForUniqueIdentifier method must be overrided.

FDModel provides the ability to transform an object just before it is set on a local key path. For example, if a subclass of FDModel has a property named 'status' and the user wants to transform the value that the remote key path resolves to they can implement a method named 'statusTransformer' that returns back a NSValueTransformer. This transformer will be automatically used whenever the status property is about to be set.

By default all FDModel objects are pesisted only in-memory. Model objects can be saved to a FDModelStore and any models that are saved to the model store and automatically read from the store if a model with the corresponding identifier is attempted to be created.
